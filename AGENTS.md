## Repository

Package: `@ankhorage/zora-tabletop`

Tabletop and card-game UI primitives for React Native and React Native Web, built on ZORA.

## Current architecture only

Only the current Ankhorage architecture is valid. Do not add or retain deprecated APIs,
compatibility aliases, shims, dual old/new paths, historical-state fallbacks, or migrations whose
sole purpose is supporting obsolete states. Remove superseded implementations instead.

When a canonical change affects another repository, update that repository to the latest released
public API instead of preserving compatibility locally. Cross-package usage must go through
published public APIs and declared dependencies, never sibling source files.

Current-runtime error handling and canonical database or infrastructure migrations remain valid
when they support states that the current architecture can intentionally produce.

## Required repository instructions

Before changing any file, read this `AGENTS.md` completely and inspect `.agents/skills/`.
Treat skill selection as a mandatory precondition to editing, then follow every selected skill
through validation and delivery.

- Load `.agents/skills/ankhorage-coding-rules/SKILL.md` for implementation, refactoring, testing,
  review, or pull-request delivery work.
- Load `.agents/skills/ankhorage-project-structure/SKILL.md` when the task changes or reviews
  directory ownership, package boundaries, public entrypoints, cross-repository ownership, type or
  utility placement, or source architecture.
- Load every additional repository-local skill whose description or requirements match the task,
  including skills required by any selected skill. These rules define mandatory minimums, not an
  allow-list; do not skip a useful relevant skill merely because it is not named here.

Do not load unrelated skills merely because they are installed. If the task scope expands, inspect
`.agents/skills/` again and load the newly relevant skills before continuing. Do not substitute
remembered, globally installed, or generic guidance for the repository-local versions.

## Documentation

`README.md` and the configured Paradox output are generated release artifacts. Never edit them
manually, and do not regenerate or commit them in ordinary feature pull requests. Update the owning
Paradox `/*** ... */` comments in `src` and leading `@usage` comments in real
`examples/<example>/...` source files, plus any repository-owned manual documentation outside the
generated output. The managed release workflow runs `bun run docs` after the package version bump
and commits the regenerated artifacts in the release commit.

## Pull requests

Before creating a pull request, run all of these commands in this order and resolve every failure:

```sh
bun run build
bun run check-types
bun run lint
bun run knip:check
bun run changeset
bun run format
```

## Skill scripts

Scripts inside an Agent Skill must always be TypeScript files with the `.ts` extension.
JavaScript skill scripts using `.js`, `.mjs`, or `.cjs` are not allowed. Run TypeScript
skill scripts with Bun.
